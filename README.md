# Lupin

This is a project to help people to register to see a famous doctor.
I assume that socioeconomic status of target consumers to Lupin service are higher than that of usual people; therefore, I figure out a business model that I charge these people when they ask me to help them register to see a famous doctor, and ask them what percentage of total charge they're willing to donate to disadvantaged groups. Once their registration is confirmed, I'll charge them and return a donation receipt to ensure their money is actually donated to disadvantaged groups.
I believe that Lupin service excludes the rights of disadvantaged groups to see a doctor; however, I saw this kind of service have already existed on the Internet and they charge a lot. I try to make it right. This is the main purpose of Lupin project.
Why Lupin ? Lupin is a guy that always rob the rich to help the poor. I think maybe his spirit is similar to this project (Correct me if I'm wrong). If not, I hope he is a guy I would like to be.
